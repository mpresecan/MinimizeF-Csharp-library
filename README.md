# MinimizeF-Csharp-library
MinimizeF.com is a blog where we study optimization algorithms. MinimizeF library contains custom written support our algorithms like Matrix/Vector Classes, with algorithms to solve linear equations.

## Containing Classes
# Matrix / Vector
Custom written Class Matrix where with all methods of overload operators, variety of constructors and LUP Decomposition
These Classes are needed as base library in future for performing optimization with multy dimensional problems.
